# Lab: CSS Grid

## Introduction
In this lab, you'll have the opportunity to recreate a piece of Mondrian Art, applying your knowledge of the CSS Grid techniques. This exercise will help solidify your understanding of how elements are structured and manipulated on a web page.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. **Fork the Repository**: Navigate to the top right corner of this page and click on the "Fork" button. This action will create a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**: To get the repository onto your local machine, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   git clone <URL_OF_YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY>
   ```

   Make sure to replace `<URL_OF_YOUR_FORKED_REPOSITORY>` with the actual URL of the repository you just forked.

3. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd the_repo_name
   ```

   Replace `the_repo_name` with the actual name of the repository you cloned.

## Contribution

1. **Commit Changes**: Throughout your project, as you make changes or complete sections, commit those changes to your local repository. Aim for commit messages that clearly describe what modifications were made.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "A brief description of the changes"
   ```

2. **Push Changes to GitHub**: After making a significant amount of progress or upon completion, push your changes back up to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

3. **Submit Your Work**: Once you're finished, submit the link to your pull request on Canvas, or according to the instructions provided by your instructor or course.
